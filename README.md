##Draw pitch contour lines in LaTeX##

When discussing pitch phenomena in linguistics, it is often helpful to be able to give a visual indication of the pitch pattern.

This file contains TikX (http://sourceforge.net/projects/pgf) code to enable the drawing of pitch levels and contours over text.  It was originally written by Mark Wibrow in response to two questions from me on TeX StackExchange:
http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/107941/using-tikz-to-depict-intonation
http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/108530/using-tikz-to-depict-pitchlevel

An example of usage can be seen on pp225-6 of my 2013 article , "Representing linguistic pitch in (Xe)LaTeX", which appeared in [TUGboat](https://www.tug.org/TUGboat/tb34-2/tb107donnelly.pdf).
